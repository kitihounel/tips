## Disable a user account

To disable a user account, we use ways as:

- Using Command Prompt: `net user <username> /active:no`.
- Using Computer Management window, navigate to System Tools > Local Users and Groups > Users.
- Using `wmic` command: `wmic useraccount where name='user-name' set disabled=true`.

```cmd
net user <username> /active:no
```

works fine, if username is like Johm, Mike, etc.

If username is like Jo Ann M. Jones, Albert.David or any typical name, the command doesnâ€™t work successfully. Mostly it shows error,
even with commands like:

```cmd
net user "Jo Ann M. Jones" /active:no
```

or

```cmd
net user 'Jo Ann M. Jones' /active:no
```
