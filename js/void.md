# void operator

The void operator in TypeScript and JavaScript evaluates an expression and
returns `undefined`. It can be used to prevent unintended leakage of return
values and handle Promises for side effects. It is useful when you want to
suppress the return value of a function or initiate a Promise without handling
its resolution.
